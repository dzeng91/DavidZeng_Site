                       Graduated from Fullstack Academy bootcamp in 2023, I am now eagerly seeking opportunities in front-end programming. 
                       My journey into the world of coding began with a fascination for technology and the exciting prospect of 
                       transitioning careers. With a background in accounting/finance and digital media advertising, 
                       I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking and creative problem-solving to my work. 
                       I am passionate about creating intuitive and user-friendly web experiences, and I'm excited to 
                       contribute my skills to innovative projects.
